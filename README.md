# texor

This will eventually become a simple text editor written in C.

I'm following along with a [tutorial](http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) to build an editor like [kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108).

## Compiling

In the command line at the project root, run:

```
make
```

## Running

After running `make`, run:

```
./texor
```

## Usage

Typing displays character codes and their printable characters, if possible.

Type `q` to quit.
